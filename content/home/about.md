# Biography
I am a Reserch Scientist at Nokia Bell labs, Cambridge UK, working with the <a href="http://social-dynamics.net/team.html">social dynamics team</a>.
<p>
My primary interests are complex networks and quantifying their emergent behaviours using the up and coming representation learning methods. My current projects deal with affective analysis of images and text for urban informatics, data driven measurements of social phenomenon and quantification of affective dimensions in online interactions.
<p> 
I was a King's India scholar at King's College London, and I worked towards my Ph.D. in computer science at Department Informatics, <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/informatics/index.aspx"> King's College London </a>, under the guidance of <a href="http://www.inf.kcl.ac.uk/staff/nrs/">Dr. Nishanth Sastry</a>. 
<p>
I have graduated with a Masters of Science (M.S.) degree from University of California at Santa Barbara majoring in signals processing and networks, and a Bachelors of Engineering (B.Eng) from University of Pune - India majoring in Electronics engineering .
