# Biography

I am a King's India scholar and a Ph.D. candidate at King's College London. I am working towards my Ph.D. in computer science at department of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, King's college, under the guidance of <a href="http://www.inf.kcl.ac.uk/staff/nrs/">Dr. Nishanth Sastry</a>. My primary interests are complex networks and their emergent behaviours. I am also interested in understanding complex structures in human interactions and in social media, using representation learning. My current projects deal with affective analysis of images, engagement analysis in social media and notions of support in complex networks.
